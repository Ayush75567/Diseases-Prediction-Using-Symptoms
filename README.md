# Disease Predictor from Patient Symptoms

## Introduction

This document provides a guide to a Jupyter Notebook project that predicts diseases based on patient symptoms. The project employs the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and utilizes a dataset sourced from Hugging Face.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (pandas, sklearn, json)

## Setup and Operation

Install Python and Jupyter Notebook on your system and ensure that the necessary libraries are installed. The project involves loading and preprocessing a dataset, creating a machine learning model, and testing the model with sample data.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Hugging Face and contains patient queries and corresponding medical responses. [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fhai50032/Symptoms_to_disease_7k)

## Algorithm Used

The project uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular choice for text classification tasks.

## Running the Project

You can run the Jupyter Notebook by launching Jupyter in your web browser and navigating to the notebook file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic application of machine learning in healthcare, aiming to assist in preliminary diagnosis based on symptoms described by patients. It's a stepping stone towards more advanced diagnostic tools.
